\chapter[Style 58]{The Maya Realm}
\label{st:58}


{\Huge\cooperup\bfseries\color{maya} T}he Metropolitan Museum of Arts is famous for its highly quality books and catalogues. Most of these books are now available online for free and the books can be ordered online. This template is based on a publication titled \emph{After Cortez}. It is not an easy task to mould a style suited to a large format book into these pages, so I have not spent too much time on the geometry. If you emply this style please adjust the geometry of the pages and the spacing of the headings to suit.

\example 
\medskip
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\hspace*{-.1\textwidth}\includegraphics[width=1.2\textwidth]{cortes2}
\caption{The opening page of a chapter in \textit{Affecting Computing}.}
\end{figure}

I am not too sure if I have matched the fonts properly, but the important point to remember is to create contrast
between the txt body and the heading. I have used a “Cooper Black” font and it did not come out too badly.
You can also try and reverse the coloring.

This is a large format book 8.50x11.00 inches. It was produced by ABBYY FineReader, 324 pages Before Cortes, 
Elizabeth Kennedy Easby; John F. Scott,1971.



The author block including the institution are added as part of the chapter head styling command.

\example The subject of having articles together in a publication such as Proceedings and Journals is a recurring theme in many Academic fields. One of course if it is possible would have liked to use a standard Journal class and automatically produce this type of publication. There are a number of such classes at \href{http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/amscls/doc/instr-l.pdf}{ctan}

\solution If you are the editor with the task of assembling all these different articles consider using the \pkgname{confproc}. The package by Vincent Verfaille assembles the proceedings from the pdfs, using the 
\pkgname{pdfpages}, which is another great way to achieve this. A simpler way is to develop a specific style for
your Conference and let the participants use it while writing their papers. Only caveat they need to import the
body of the paper with \string\input\meta{article name}. As the \pkgname{phd} comes pre-packaged with
numerous packages the chance of someone using a package that the editor or the system needs to use it
is minimized. Indexing, bibliographies and the like might need to be taken care of and this is discussed in the relevant chapters. There are many options and peculiarities that might not be covered by the phd package so my suggestion is to try it on a few older papers first.

\example  Style-08 has to set the caption style to include for a period after the label number as shown in the Fig.~\ref{fig:eight02}. This can be achieved through key settings or a package.
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{cortes}
\caption{Figures are centered, with the caption flush left and the \textit{Figure} label abbreviated to Fig. (with a stop). The section number also has the dot and follows the style of the sections.}
\label{fig:eight02}
\end{figure}

The figures numbers are reset at every chapter. Normally authors use the \pkgname{chngctr} to achieve such changes, which involves two modifications. Redefining whether or not the figure counter will be reset whenever the chapter/section counter is incremented; Redefining the "appearance" of the figure counter (\string\thefigure), i.e., removing (or adding) the chapter/section prefix.


The standard solution – which deals with modifications 1 and 2 mentioned above – is to use the \string\counterwithout and \string\counterwithin macros of the \texttt{chngcntr package}.\footnote{\protect\url{http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/28333/continuous-v-per-chapter-section-numbering-of-figures-tables-and-other-docume}} 


\section{Tables}

The Tables follow the style for figures as far as captioning. They are all framed and although there is a genuine distain in the \latexe community for this type of style, I must admit that they are blending well with the style of this book. Another typographical tradition that has been broken in this book is that the table captions are placed below the table and not above.

\example
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./images/affective-computing-tables.jpg}
\caption{Figures are centered, with the caption flush left and the \textit{Figure} label abbreviated to Fig. (with a stop). The section number also has the dot and follows the style of the sections.}
\label{fig:eight02}
\end{figure}


\begin{verbatim}
\cxset{table numbering=without}
\end{verbatim}

\setlength\extrarowheight{5pt}

\bgroup
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|c|c|c|X|}
\hline
Affective Movement & Mean & Standard Deviation &\RaggedRight Standard Error of the Mean\\
\hline
confident & (0.150,0.100,0.150) & (0.362,0.304,0.362)&(0.57,0.48,0.57)\\
\hline
\end{tabularx}
\caption{The table style of the book, with the caption below. You may need to increase the cell lengths.}
\end{table}
\egroup

The cell heights of the table have been increaded by 5pt, using,
\begin{verbatim}
\setlength\extrarowheight{5pt}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Front Matter}

The Front Matter includes a Title Page, Table of Contents and a Preface. Nothing special or exciting here with the exception of the Table of Contents which is a bit on the difficult side. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./images/affecting-computing-contents.jpg}
\caption{Figures are centered, with the caption flush left and the \textit{Figure} label abbreviated to Fig. (with a stop). The section number also has the dot and follows the style of the sections.}
\label{fig:eight02}
\end{figure}

\section{Back Matter}



For the handling of the References there are numerous options and these are discussed under the Bibliography and References chapter.\footnote{\protect\url{http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/87991/putting-bibliographies-at-the-end-of-each-chapter}} The referencing styles within paragraphs of text are author year in square brackets. I leave this to you.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./images/affective-computing-references.jpg}
\caption{Figures are centered, with the caption flush left and the \textit{Figure} label abbreviated to Fig. (with a stop). The section number also has the dot and follows the style of the sections.}
\label{fig:eight02}
\end{figure}

\parindent1em

There are no book divisions, such as an Index at the back of the book, but each chapter has its own references section, styled as a section. The occassional single Appendix appears at the end of a chapter, styled after sections and with no numbering marks.

\section{Concluding Remarks}

This template has a unique character and in my opinion deserves a bit better. Styling for algorithms, computer code additional floating sections and an index is not provided in the template and is left open for the user. It works well with the book class and with the KOMA classes. I have also given it an alias \emph{humanoid}\footnote{From one of the chapters in the book discussing the development of humanoids that can express emotions. The scientific field of human emotions and its applications both on the web as well as robotics is a vast topic. I did waste a lot of time reading the book rather than developing the style. } A minimal to use the template is shown below:

\caption{Figures are centered, with the caption flush left and the \textit{Figure} label abbreviated to Fig. (with a stop). The section number also has the dot and follows the style of the sections.}
\label{fig:eight02}
\end{figure}
