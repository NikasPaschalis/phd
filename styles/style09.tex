\chapter{Preparing for Trial}

Template number nine, is from a book about a the Rivonia Trial. The template is easy to set up and is has a simple but effective design, which I think is very appropriate for a journalistic type of book.

When South Africa's apartheid government charged Nelson Mandela with planning its overthrow in 1963, most observers feared that he would be sentenced to death. But the support he and his fellow activists in the African National Congress received during his trial not only saved his life, but also enabled him to save his country. In Saving Nelson Mandela, South African law expert Kenneth S. Broun recreates the trial--called the ``Rivonia" Trial after the Johannesburg suburb where police seized Mandela. Based upon interviews with many of the case's primary figures and portions of the trial transcript, Broun situates readers inside the courtroom at the imposing Palace of Justice in Pretoria. Here, the trial unfolds through a dramatic narrative that captures the courage of the accused and their defense team, as well as the personal prejudices that colored the entire trial. The Rivonia trial had no jury and only a superficial aura of due process, combined with heavy security that symbolized the apartheid government's system of repression. 

Broun shows how outstanding advocacy, combined with widespread public support, in fact backfired on apartheid leaders, who sealed their own fate. Despite his 27-year incarceration, Mandela's ultimate release helped move his country from the racial tyranny of apartheid toward democracy. As documented in this inspirational book, the Rivonia trial was a critical milestone that helped chart the end of Apartheid and the future of a new South Africa.

``Kenneth Broun does justice indeed to one of the most celebrated political trials of the 20th century...the result is not only a gripping story but a work of profound scholarship, sensitivity, and empathy." --Mark Gevisser, author of A Legacy of Liberation 

``Part history, part sociology, part engrossing legal drama, this important book recounts a seminal moment in South Africa's history." --Penelope Andrews, City University of New York School of Law

Many things are going wrong in South Africa, but it would have been worse if it was not for Mandela.

\section{Adjusting the Rule}

You might want to fiddle with the rule settings, as well as the section settings. I prefer the sections centered and not numbered.
