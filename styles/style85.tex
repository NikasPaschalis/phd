\chapter[template 85]{Keeping Count\\ Writing Whole Numbers}


\lettrine{T}{}he problem of how to write numbers efficiently has been with humanity for as long as there have been
sheep to count count or things to trade. The simplest the most primitive way to do this was (and still is) by tallying---making a simple mark, for each thing counted. Thus, \emph{one, two, three, four, five,}\ldots were writen or carved as:\\
\hbox to \textwidth{{\fboxrule0pt\fboxsep0pt\bfseries
\hfill\hfill\hbox to 0.5\textwidth{\fbox{\textbar}\hfill\fbox{\textbar\textbar}\hfill\fbox{\textbar\textbar\textbar}
\hfill\fbox{\textbar\textbar\textbar\textbar} \hfill\cancel{\fbox{\textbar\textbar\textbar\textbar}}}\hfill\hfill
}}\\
and so on. People still use this for scorekeeping in simple games, class elections and the like, sometimes bunching the stroke marks by fives.

The simplicity of the tally system is also its greatest weakness. It uses only one simple as very long strings of symbols are required to write even moderately small numbers. As civilization progressed various cultures improved on this
method by choosing a few more symbols and stringing them together until their values added up to the number they wanted. These symbols were pictographic; that is they were small picture drawings of common or not so common things.
