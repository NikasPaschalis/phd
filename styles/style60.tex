%\chapter{On the History of Moral Philosophy in Greece previous to Aristotle.}

\chapter[The History of Ethics]{On the Nichomachean Ethics, in relation to the other Ethical Writings included among the Works of Aristotle.}

This book has unusual chapter title formats. Also like the previous style (style 59) it uses \textsf{ESSAY} instead of \textsf{CHAPTER}. The geometry of the book cannot be represented properly here  and hence you need to have a good look at the book to simulate its looks. The chapter titles have two possibilities, they are either hanged or centered.

\section{Formatting the Chapter Heading}

The formatting of the title follows a rule that if it exceeds two lines minus a tolerance it is set using a hanged indentation, starting from the second line. 

\begin{texexample}{}{}
{\parskip0pt
\Large \bfseries \itshape\language-1
\rightskip3cm
\hangindent1.5cm \hangafter1
On the Nichomachean Ethics, in relation to the other Ethical Writings included among the Works of Aristotle.
\par
}
\end{texexample}

In order to format this type of title we will need to use \cmd{\hangindent} and \cmd{\hangafter}. We will also need to measure the length of the title in order to algorithmically decide if we want the titled centered or not. 

\newsavebox{\testbox}
\savebox\testbox{{\parskip0pt
\Large \bfseries \itshape\language-1
On the Nichomachean Ethics, in relation to the other Ethical Writings included among the Works of Aristotle.
\par
}}

If the title is greater than twice the textwidth we will use indentation otherwise we will center it. The test will take
the form:

\begin{texexample}{}{}
\ifdim\wd\testbox>\textwidth true \else false\fi
\end{texexample}

To avoid problems with expansion it will be better to have in in the form of:
       
\begin{texexample}{}{}
\makeatletter
\def\@hangthetitle#1{%
\parskip0pt
\hbox to \columnwidth{\hss\vbox{{%
        \centerline{\includegraphics[width=1.6cm]{ornamental-rule}}%
        \titlemargintop@cx
        \Large \bfseries \itshape\language-1
         \hangindent1.5cm \hangafter1
         #1
          \par
       \titlemarginbottom@cx
       }}\hss}%
}
\def\@centerthetitle#1{\Large\bfseries\itshape\centering#1\par}

\def\hangorcenter#1{%
   \savebox\testbox{{\parskip0pt
   \Large \bfseries \itshape\language-1
   #1
   \par
}}

\ifdim\wd\testbox>\textwidth
   \expandafter\@hangthetitle
\else 
   \@centerthetitle
\fi{#1}}

\hangorcenter{\lorem }

\hangorcenter{Short Title}
\makeatother
\end{texexample}

The final definitions will need to be refined a bit more to capture the rest of the details and to make them 
a bit more robust.


\begin{verbatim}
\cxset{chapter name=ESSAY}
\end{verbatim}
The book was orginally published in 1722 and the edition here was printed in 1830 by J.S \& C. Adams \& Co. in Amherst Massachussets, so it is representative of early American printed works.
