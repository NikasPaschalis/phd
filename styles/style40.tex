\chapter{Introduction: On Why and How to Use Chapter Style Forty}

\label{ch:style40}

A simple design for sombre multi-author books. This type of design is now common in many publications such as proceedings, conferences and the like. They are actually mostly collections of articles, but formatted as books. The style comes with many variants.

One issue with such designs is how to make it easy for the user to add the author block. There are two pathways, the one is to use \cs{cxset} and the other is to make a special command for it.
