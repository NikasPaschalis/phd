the University of Texas Press. The translation is by Brian S. Bauer, Vania Smith-Oka and Gabriel E. Cantarutti who did an excellent job. The typesetting attracted my attention by its effective simplicity and I read the book in one evening. The book size is 5.50 x 8.50 in, pages 187. Times Roman, ArnoPro and Ovidius. The Ovidius font was designed by  Thaddeus Szumilas and 
belongs to a family known as eroded fonts. It has found many devoted users especially for book covers.

This template has a lot of potential and I will come back to it and add more key hooks for lettrine settings per letter and font management. They can also come alive with a gold color.

The dropcap in the original book as well as the chapter font is given a worn style (Ovidius Demi font\footnote{Available at the fontpalace website \protect\url{http://www.fontpalace.com/font-download/Ovidius Demi/}}), I guess in order to give it a touch of style reminiscent of a manuscript. It can also look
good using |calligra| and also a bit of color. You can experiment also with many other calligraphic fonts. The example below demonstrates the use of the |calligra| font.

The dropcap looks as good if not better with the |calligra| font and I have given it a colour to stand out. The chapter number has to be increased in height, so I have used |huge|. The new

The sections are typeset in normal font and are centered.
