Animal behavior provides a wealth of interesting and accessible examples
of collective phenomena and complex systems. Most people are
familiar with ant trails; cockroach aggregations; fish schools; bird migrations;
honeybee swarms; web construction by spiders; and locust marching,
even if they have not observed them personally. In these systems
there are two clearly defined levels of organization that we aim to link
together: the animal and the group. This clarity stands in contrast to
many other collective phenomena, such as protein interactions or ecological
webs, where it can be difficult to establish exactly on which level
to observe a system. Thus animal behavior provides much needed case
studies of how complex systems theory can be put into practice. 

\section{Technical}

You may need to set the fonts and spacing to your liking here. The main point was to introduce the property
|border-style=double|. This can be applied either selectively or globally to all elements. The border styles can be extended by the use of the property |number border-bottom-style-custom|, where the value is 
any valid CSS name.

 \chapter[Template 95]{Information Transfer}         
          
 \dropcap{O}{}ne reason why animal groups are such a popular subject for scientific
study is the importance of social interactions in our own everyday experience.
Humans are inherently social animals, whose activities exhibit
many of the elements of co-operation and conflict found in other animal
societies. these social activities are extremely important to us: they determine
our economic welfare; they produce a great deal of emotional
turmoil, often providing the main reasons for whether we are happy
or not; they determine how we are governed and how we structure our
workplaces; and they even determine simple every day activities, such as
how long we have to wait in queues.

Can some of the techniques used to study collective animal behavior
be applied to understanding human societies? the answer is a qualified
“yes.” in narrowly defined social situations, such as in pedestrian movement
and spectator crowds, some of the techniques used to understand
collective animal behavior can be applied to humans. in wider situations,
such as consumer decision-making and the “evolution” of fads and fashions,
there could also be applications. recent studies have looked at how
our tendencies to buy particular items, find employment, and even commit
crime change with the behaviors of those around us. Many of the underlying
dynamics of these processes are similar to those seen in animal
groups and this book seeks to highlight how these similarities arise.
