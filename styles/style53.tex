\chapter[Style 53]{VAULT OF THE AGES STYLE FIFTY THREE}


The book alleges the discovery of Jesus tomp \cite{style53}. True or not, the book eloquently describes  life in Israel in the early years of the second millenium.\footnote{From \textit{The
Jesus
Family
Tomb,   
The Discovery, the Investigation,
and the Evidence
That Could Change History}, 
Simcha Jacobovici and Charles Pellegrino
Harper Collins.}

Simcha Jacobovici and Charles
Pellegrino have carried out and delivered evidence based on their own investigations to 
connect a first-century Jewish tomb found in Talpiot, Jerusalem,
in 1980 to the tomb of Jesus and his family. They also provide physical evidence from within the tomb says about Jesus, his death, and his relationships with the other family members found in
the same burial site. I read the book and remained unconvinced.
