Meithei (Meitei) /ˈmeɪteɪ/,[4] also known as Manipuri /mænɨˈpʊəri/ ({\pan মৈতৈলোন্} \textmeitei{ꯃꯧꯇꯧꯂꯣꯟ} Meitei-lon or {\pan মৈতৈলোল্} \textmeitei{ꯃꯧꯇꯧꯂꯣꯜ} Meitei-lol), is the predominant language and lingua franca in the southeastern Himalayan state of Manipur, in northeastern India. It is the official language in government offices. Meithei is also spoken in the Indian states of Assam and Tripura, and in Bangladesh and Burma (now Myanmar).

Meithei is a Tibeto-Burman language whose exact classification remains unclear, though it shows lexical resemblances to Kuki and Tangkhul Naga.[5] The language is spoken by more than 1.5 million people.

Meithei has proven to be an integrating factor among all ethnic groups in Manipur who use it to communicate among themselves. It has been recognized (as Manipuri), by the Indian Union and has been included in the list of scheduled languages (included in the 8th schedule by the 71st amendment of the constitution in 1992). Meithei is taught as a subject up to the post-graduate level (Ph.D.) in universities of India, apart from being a medium of instruction up to the undergraduate level in Manipur.
