The Tamil script (\tamiltext{தமிழ் அரிச்சுவடி} tamiḻ ariccuvaṭi) is an abugida script that is used by the Tamil people in India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and elsewhere, to write the Tamil language, as well as to write the liturgical language Sanskrit, using consonants and diacritics not represented in the Tamil alphabet.[1] Certain minority languages such as Saurashtra, Badaga, Irula, and Paniya are also written in the Tamil script

The Tamil script has 12 vowels (\tamiltext{உயிரெழுத்து} uyireḻuttu "soul-letters"), 18 consonants (\tamiltext{மெய்யெழுத்து} meyyeḻuttu "body-letters") and one character, the āytam \tamiltext{ஃ (ஆய்தம்)}, which is classified in Tamil grammar as being neither a consonant nor a vowel (\tamiltext{அலியெழுத்து} aliyeḻuttu "the hermaphrodite letter"), though often considered as part of the vowel set (\tamiltext{உயிரெழுத்துக்கள்} uyireḻuttukkaḷ "vowel class"). The script, however, is syllabic and not alphabetic.[3] The complete script, therefore, consists of the thirty-one letters in their independent form, and an additional 216 combinant letters representing a total 247 combinations (\tamiltext{உயிர்மெய்யெழுத்து} uyirmeyyeḻuttu) of a consonant and a vowel, a mute consonant, or a vowel alone. These combinant letters are formed by adding a vowel marker to the consonant. Some vowels require the basic shape of the consonant to be altered in a way that is specific to that vowel. Others are written by adding a vowel-specific suffix to the consonant, yet others a prefix, and finally some vowels require adding both a prefix and a suffix to the consonant. In every case the vowel marker is different from the standalone character for the vowel.
The Tamil script is written from left to right.
