\chapter{Ancient and Historic Scripts}

Unicode encodes a number of ancient scripts, which have not been in normal use for a millennium or more, as well as historic scripts, whose usage ended in recent centuries. Although these scripts are no longer used to write living languages, documents and inscriptions using these languages exist, both for extinct languages and for precursors of modern languages. The primary user communities for these scripts are scholars, interested in studying the scripts and the languages written in them. A few, such as Coptic, also have contemporary liturgical or other special purposes. Some of the historic scripts are related to each other as well as to modern alphabets. The following are provides as of Unicode version~7.2.
