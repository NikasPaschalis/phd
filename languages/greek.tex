``The Phoenicians who came with Kadmos,'' wrote Herodotus in the fifth century BC of the legendary Phoenician prince of Tyre and brother of Europa, ``\ldots introduced into Greece, after their settlement in the country, a number of accomplishments of which the most important was writing, an art which probably was unknown to the Greeks until then''. 

The Greek alphabet is the script that has been used to write the Greek language since the 8th century BC. It was derived from the earlier Phoenician alphabet, and was in turn the ancestor of numerous other European and Middle Eastern scripts, including Cyrillic and Latin.[3] Apart from its use in writing the Greek language, both in its ancient and its modern forms, the Greek alphabet today also serves as a source of technical symbols and labels in many domains of mathematics, science and other fields.

In its classical and modern forms, the alphabet has 24 letters, ordered from alpha to omega. Like Latin and Cyrillic, Greek originally had only a single form of each letter; it developed the letter case distinction between upper-case and lower-case forms in parallel with Latin during the modern era.

\tex has built-in commands for the usage of the Greek alphabet see section \ref{greek} in the Symbols chapter.

With a suitable font such as |Arial Unicode MS| you do not need to do anything special to typeset short paragraphs of Greek text. Just use any editor set to encode the text in \utfviii. The example below was just cut and pasted.

\begin{quote}
Ἡροδότου Ἁλικαρνησσέος ἱστορίης ἀπόδεξις ἥδε, ὡς μήτε τὰ γενόμενα ἐξ ἀνθρώπων τῷ χρόνῳ ἐξίτηλα γένηται, μήτε ἔργα μεγάλα τε καὶ θωμαστά, τὰ μὲν Ἕλλησι, τὰ δὲ βαρβάροισι ἀποδεχθέντα, ἀκλεᾶ γένηται, τὰ τε ἄλλα καὶ δι' ἣν αἰτίην ἐπολέμησαν ἀλλήλοισι.[2]

Herodotus of Halicarnassus, his Researches are set down to preserve the memory of the past by putting on record the astonishing achievements of both the Greeks and the Barbarians; and more particularly, to show how they came into conflict.[3]

\subsection{Greek diacritics}
\index{Greek>polytonic}

The ancient Greek writing included for many accents and diacritics. The extended unicode standard provides slots for all diacritics. Greek orthography has used a variety of diacritics starting in the Hellenistic period. The complex polytonic orthography notates Ancient Greek phonology. The simple monotonic orthography, introduced in 1982, corresponds to Modern Greek phonology, and requires only two diacritics.

Polytonic orthography (πολύς "much", "many", τόνος "accent") is the standard system for Ancient Greek. The acute accent ( ´ ), the grave accent ( ` ), and the circumflex ( ῀ ) indicate different kinds of pitch accent. The rough breathing ( ῾ ) indicates the presence of an /h/ sound before a letter, while the smooth breathing ( ᾿ ) indicates the absence of /h/.

Since in Modern Greek the pitch accent was replaced by a dynamic accent, and the /h/ was lost, most polytonic diacritics have no phonetic significance, and merely reveal the underlying Ancient Greek etymology.

Monotonic orthography (μόνος "single", τόνος "accent") is the standard system for Modern Greek. It retains a single accent or tonos (΄) to indicate stress and the diaeresis (¨) to indicate a diphthong: compare modern Greek παϊδάκια /pajˈðaca/ "lamb chops", with a diphthong, and παιδάκια /peˈðacia/ "little children" with a simple vowel. Tonos and diaeresis can be combined on a single vowel, as in the verb ταΐζω (/taˈizo/ "to feed").
