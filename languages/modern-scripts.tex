Ethiopic, Mongolian, and Tifinagh are scripts with long histories. Although their roots can
be traced back to the original Semitic and North African writing systems, they would not
be classified as Middle Eastern scripts today

The Cherokee script is a syllabary developed between 1815 and 1821, to write the Cherokee
language, still spoken by small communities in Oklahoma and North Carolina. Canadian
Aboriginal Syllabics were invented in the 1830s for Algonquian languages in Canada. The
system has been extended many times, and is now actively used by other communities, including speakers of Inuktitut and Athapascan languages.

Deseret is a phonemic alphabet devised in the 1850s to write English. It saw limited use for
a few decades by members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Shavian is
another phonemic alphabet, invented in the 1950s to write English. It was used to publish
one book in 1962, but remains of some current interest
