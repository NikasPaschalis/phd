\chapter{Unicode}

Unicode is an encoding of \textit{characters}, and it is the first encoding that took the trouble to define what a
\textit{character} is. The distinction between a character and a \textit{glyph} has come to be of interest een to philosophers with the Japanese philosopher Shigeki Moro to say that Unicodeâ€™s approach is Aristotelian essentialist. 

In this book we adopt the practical definition given by Spyropoulos in his book Unicode \& Encodings. 

\begin{itemize}

\item A glyph is the image of a symbol used in a writing system (in an alphabet, a syllabary, a set of ideographs, etc.) or in a notational system (like music, mathematics, cartography etc.)

\item A \textit{character} is the simple description, primarily linguistic or logical, of an equivalence class of glyphs.
\end{itemize}

\section{Unicode's Principles.}

Unicode subscribes to ten principles.
