\begin{bache}
This layout has a dominant left column image. It is important to
ensure that the image has an aspect ratio to suit. Unfortunately
it is very difficult to crop and scale an image via \tex so a bit
of experimentation is appropriate.

It is also important to ensure that you add an adequate amount
of text during editing, otherwise the layout will not look very good. The right
column has two images (it really looks better when it has two images rather than
one and the bottom image is really a filler, if you have more or less
text you may have to go back and crop the image to suit. Any extra space on the right column is used as glue.
