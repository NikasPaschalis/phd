\chapter{South Asian Scripts}

The scripts of South Asia share so many characteristics that a side by side comparison of a few often reveal structural similarities even in the 
modern letterforms.

\section{Devanagari}
\parindent1em

Devanagari is part of the Brahmic family of scripts of India, Nepal, Tibet, and South-East Asia.[2] It is a descendant of the Gupta script, along with Siddham and Sharada.[2] Eastern variants of Gupta called nāgarī are first attested from the 7th century CE; from c. 1200 CE these gradually replaced Siddham, which survived as a vehicle for Tantric Buddhism in East Asia, and Sharada, which remained in parallel use in Kashmir. An early version of Devanagari is visible in the Kutila inscription of Bareilly dated to Vikram Samvat 1049 (i.e. 992 CE), which demonstrates the emergence of the horizontal bar to group letters belonging to a word.[3]

Sanskrit nāgarī is the feminine of nāgara "relating or belonging to a town or city". It is feminine from its original phrasing with lipi ("script") as nāgarī lipi "script relating to a city", that is, probably from its having originated in some city.[4]

The use of the name devanāgarī is relatively recent, and the older term nāgarī is still common.[2] The rapid spread of the term devanāgarī may be related to the almost exclusive use of this script to publish Sanskrit texts in print since the 1870s.[2]

On Windows use \texttt{Arial Unicode MS}.

On Linux \texttt{Lohit} is a font family designed to cover Indic scripts and released by Red Hat. The Lohit fonts currently cover 11 languages: Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu.[1] The fonts were supplied by Modular Infotech and licensed under the GPL. In September 2011, they were retroactively relicensed under the OFL.[2] The Lohit fonts are used as web fonts by some Wikimedia Foundation sites, like Wikipedia, since March 2012.The font currently support 21 Indian languages.

\subsubsection{Punctuation} 
The end of a sentence or half-verse may be marked with a dot known as a pūrna virām or a vertical line danda: \textbar. The end of a full verse may be marked with two vertical lines: \textbar\textbar. A comma, or alpa virām, is used to denote a natural pause in speech. With expansion of English speakers in India, the full stop is also sometimes used.

\subsection{LaTeX support}

\latex2e support can be found in the \pkgname{sanskrit}. The package contains the font files and pre-processor for printing Sanskrit
text in both devanāgarī and transliterated Roman with diacritics. Another package that can be used with \XeTeX\ is support \pkgname{devnag}.  This was originally developed by Frans Velthuis for the University of Groningen, The Netherlands, and it was the first system to provide
support for the script for \tex. The package was  extended by Anshuman Pandey. The package provides both fonts as well as tranliteration macros.


\subsection{Gujarati}


Gujarati has its own writing system, distinct but related to several other Indian languages' writing systems, such as the one used to write Hindi. Strictly speaking, the Gujarati writing system is what is called an \emph{abugida} (and not an \textit{alphabet}), because the consonant characters all contain an inherent vowel, and other vowels are written as accents added on to the consonant characters. There are also symbols for stand-alone vowels.

The Gujarati script ({\gujarati{ગુજરાતી લિપિ }} Gujǎrātī Lipi), which like all Nāgarī writing systems is strictly speaking an abugida rather than an alphabet, is used to write the Gujarati and Kutchi languages. It is a variant of Devanāgarī script differentiated by the loss of the characteristic horizontal line running above the letters and by a small number of modifications in the remaining characters.
With a few additional characters, added for this purpose, the Gujarati script is also often used to write Sanskrit and Hindi.
Gujarati numerical digits are also different from their Devanagari counterparts.

Gujarati has its own set of numeric signs (placed alongside their Hindu-Arabic [or Indo-Arabic] counterparts in the tables below), they are employed in much the same way as English;  that is to say, they are put together in the same manner in order to express larger numbers. It is quite possible to simply substitute the Gujarati numerals for the Hindu-Arabic ones.

\subsection{Saurashtra}

\newfontfamily\saurashtra{code2000.ttf}

Saurashtra or Sourashtra or {\saurashtra ꢱꣃꢬꢵꢰ꣄ꢜ꣄ꢬꢵ} or Palkar or Patkar (Sanskrit: सौराष्ट्र, Tamil: சௌராட்டிரம்) is an Indo-Aryan language[3] spoken by the Saurashtrian community native to Gujarat, who migrated and settled in Southern India. Madurai in Tamil Nadu has the highest number of people belonging to this community and also remains as their cultural center.

The language is largely only in spoken form even though the language has its own script. The lack of schools teaching Saurashtra script and the language is often cited as a reason for the very few number of people who actually know to read and write in Saurashtra script. Latin, Devanagari or Tamil script is used as alternative for Saurashtra Script by many Saurashtrians.

Census of India places the language under Gujarati. Official figures show the number of speakers as 185,420 (2001 census).[4]

\subsection{Ol Chiki script}

The Ol Chiki script, also known as Ol Cemetʼ (Santali: ol 'writing', cemet' 'learning'), Ol Ciki, Ol, and sometimes as the Santali alphabet, was created in 1925 by Raghunath Murmu for the Santali language.

Previously, Santali had been written with the Latin alphabet. But because Santali is not an Indo-Aryan language (like most other languages in the south of India), Indic scripts did not have letters for all of Santali's phonemes, especially its stop consonants and vowels, which made writing the language accurately in an unmodified Indic script difficult. The detailed analysis was given by Dr. Byomkes Chakrabarti in his 'Comparative Study of Santali and Bengali'. Missionaries (first of all Paul Olaf Bodding, a Norwegian) brought the Latin script, which is better at representing Santali stops, phonemes and nasal sounds with the use of diacritical marks and accents. Unlike most Indic scripts, which are derived from Brahmi, Ol Chiki is not an abugida, with vowels given equal representation with consonants. Additionally, it was designed specifically for the language, but one letter could not be assigned to each phoneme because the sixth vowel in Ol Chiki is still problematic.
Ol Chiki has 30 letters, the forms of which are intended to evoke natural shapes. Linguist Norman Zide said "The shapes of the letters are not arbitrary, but reflect the names for the letters, which are words, usually the names of objects or actions representing conventionalized form in the pictorial shape of the characters."[1] It is written from left to right.

The Lepcha script, or Róng script is an abugida used by the Lepcha people to write the Lepcha language. Unusually for an abugida, syllable-final consonants are written as diacritics.

The Mingzat font is still under development by SIL so I am not too sure if the rendering is correct\footnote{\url{http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=Mingzat}}.

\subsection{Sharada}

The Śāradā, or Sharada, script (शारदा) is an abugida writing system of the Brahmic family of scripts, developed around the 8th century. It was used for writing Sanskrit and Kashmiri. The Gurmukhī script was developed from Śāradā. Originally more widespread, its use became later restricted to Kashmir, and it is now rarely used except by the Kashmiri Pandit community for ceremonial purposes. Śāradā is another name for Saraswati, the goddess of learning.
Śāradā script was added to the Unicode Standard in January, 2012 with the release of version 6.1.

The Unicode block for Śāradā script, called Sharada, is U+11180–U+111DF: Unable to locate font in unicode.


\subsection{Sora Sompeng}

Sorang Sompeng script is used to write in Sora, a Munda language with 300,000 speakers in India. The script was created by Mangei Gomango in 1936 and is used in religious contexts.[1] He was familiar with Oriya, Telugu and English, so the parent systems of the script are Brahmi and Latin.[2]
The Sora language is also written in the Latin alphabet and the Telugu script.

Sorang Sompeng script was added to the Unicode Standard in January, 2012 with the release of version 6.1. Nirmala UI.ttf (Windows 8.1)

Widespread use was limited to about a hundred years during the Yuan Dynasty, and it fell out of use with the advent of the Ming dynasty. The documentation of its use provides clues about the changes in the varieties of Chinese, the Tibetic languages, Mongolian and other neighboring languages during the Yuan era.

Phags-pa is a historical script related to Tibetan that was created as the national script of
the Mongol empire. Even though Phags-pa was used mostly in Eastern and Central Asia for
writing text in the Mongolian and Chinese languages, it is discussed in this chapter because
of its close historical connection to the Tibetan script. The script has very limited modern use. It bears similarity to Tibetan and has no case distinctions. It is written vertically in columns running for left to right, like Mongolian. Units are often composed of several syllables and sometimes are separated by whitespace.


\subsection{Syloti Nagri}
\index{languages>Sylheti Nagari}
Sylheti Nagari or Syloti Nagri (Silôṭi Nagôri) is the original script used for writing the Sylheti language. It is an almost extinct script, this is because the Sylheti Language itself was reduced to only dialect status after Bangladesh gained independence and because it did not make sense for a dialect to have its own script, its use was heavily discouraged. The government of the newly formed Bangladesh did so to promote a greater "Bengali" identity. This led to the informal adoption of the Eastern Nagari script also used for Bengali and Assamese. It is also known as Jalalabadi Nagri, Mosolmani Nagri, Ful Nagri etc.

\subsection{Brahmi}



Brāhmī is the modern name given to one of the oldest writing systems used in the Indian subcontinent and in Central Asia during the final centuries BCE and the early centuries CE. Like its contemporary, Kharoṣṭhī, which was used in what is now Afghanistan and Western Pakistan, Brahmi (native to north and central India) was an \emph{abugida}.

The best-known Brahmi inscriptions are the rock-cut edicts of Ashoka in north-central India, dated to 250–232 BCE. The script was deciphered in 1837 by James Prinsep, an archaeologist, philologist, and official of the East India Company.[1] The origin of the script is still much debated, with current Western academic opinion generally agreeing (with some exceptions) that Brahmi was derived from or at least influenced by one or more contemporary Semitic scripts, but a current of opinion in India favors the idea that it is connected to the much older and as-yet undeciphered Indus script
