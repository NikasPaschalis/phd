###The `phd` LaTeX2e package

This latex package and the class with the same name provide
convenient methods to create new styles for books, reports
and articles. It also preloads the most commonly used packages
and resolves conflicts.

This work consists of the file  `phd.dtx`,
and the derived files   `phd.ins`,  `phd.pdf`, and `phd.sty`.

###Installation

run

           pdflatex phd.dtx
           makeindex -s gind.ist phd.idx
